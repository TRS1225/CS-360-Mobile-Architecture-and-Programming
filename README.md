# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This was an application to track inventory item stock for any business that operates a warehouse or has inventory. Written in Java and developed within Android Studio, first I designed the UI specifications, and then later, developed the coded functionality and logic to operate the UI components. This application is efficient, user friendly, and allows users to keep track of items within their inventory with details such as item name, item quantity, and item date. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Functionality includes multiple screens featuring the ability for users to create an account, login, add or remove inventory items, recieve SMS notifications which alert the user that their inventory is low, text-based SMS permission status, and navigational functions which all the user to navigate between screens within the application. Target audience for this app are primarily warehouse staff and managers who are looking for a user friendly, straightforward app which allows them to view, update and keep track of their inventory items at all times. The design of this app is sucessful because it not only met required functionality, but was also easy to understand and operate.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

When designing the UI, I built components according to the functionality that was required. I customized those UI components to optimize user friendliness and operability. In the development phase, I first implemented the code that I knew was necessary, tested the application, and changed the code according to test results. As more changes were made, more testing was done, until the project was complete. Overall, an interative and modular strategy which can be implemented again in the future depending on the complexity and demands of the application itself.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

In order to ensure code was functional, I first added a virtual device, then ran the application within Android Studio. After initially seeing that the results weren't meeting requirements, I made changes in the code, along with a few small changes in the activity layouts, until the application was complete. The process was essentially to make a change in code, then run the application to see the results. This process is of vital importance because the results of the code are seen after the application is executed.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

At some point during the development phase, I realized that the app needed functionality to navigate between the database page and the notifications page. At this point, I added buttons to these pages which when clicked, brought the user to the other page.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

In my opinion, what stood out was the combination of the simplicity of the code itself, and the user friendliness of the UI.
